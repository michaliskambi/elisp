# Goal

Trying to get Pascal intelligent completion in Emacs using LSP.

LSP is cross-editor protocol, known from VS Code but useful in other editors alike,
see https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/ .

## Testing various LSP Pascal servers in VS Code

- LSP server:

    fork 1 https://github.com/genericptr/pascal-language-server

      ```
      git clone https://github.com/genericptr/pascal-language-server genericptr-pascal-language-server
      cd genericptr-pascal-language-server
      fix in options.pas: constructor Create(_commands: TStringArray);
      sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev
      lazbuild pasls.lpi

      TODO: cannot make it to work in VS Code, VS Code reports (when opening any Pascal file):

      [Error - 02:25:51] Server initialization failed.
        Message: TFPCUnitToSrcCache.GetConfigCache missing CompilerFilename
        Code: -32603
      [Error - 02:25:51] Starting client failed
        Message: TFPCUnitToSrcCache.GetConfigCache missing CompilerFilename
        Code: -32603

      From Emacs lsp-pascal, fails with the same message.
      ```

    fork family 2:
      https://github.com/Isopod/pascal-language-server
      https://github.com/Kagamma/pascal-language-server
      https://github.com/castle-engine/pascal-language-server

      ```
      git clone https://github.com/castle-engine/pascal-language-server cge-pascal-language-server
      cd cge-pascal-language-server/
      git submodule update --init --recursive
      cd server
      lazbuild pasls.lpi
      create $HOME/.config/pasls/castle-pasls.ini following https://github.com/castle-engine/pascal-language-server docs

      DONE: Works in VS Code, for simple Pascal programs.

      TODO: Make it aware of even LCL units? Seems like it cannot find any LCL unit,
      despite setting Lazarus dir.

      DONE: Make it aware of CGE paths, make it do completion in CGE units like gamestatemain.pas.
      Done in https://github.com/castle-engine/pascal-language-server
      by special option in config file.
      ```

- VS Code Extension (not useful for Emacs users, just mentioning for completeness):

    https://github.com/genericptr/pasls-vscode

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/genericptr/pasls-vscode
    install vsix
    config:
    - FPC sources:
    - Laz sources:
    - FPC exe:
    - pasls exe: the one you got from above
    ```

## Use from Emacs

- lsp-pascal from https://github.com/arjanadriaanse/lsp-pascal is in Melpa now.
  So just install it.

- lsp-mode will be installed as dependency of lsp-pascal

- lsp-ivy (because I like Ivy completion)

- lsp-ui

- company (completion framework that lsp needs to work)

## Add this to ~/.emacs

```
(add-to-list 'load-path (concat kambi-elisp-path "lsp/"))
(require 'kambi-pascal-lsp)
```

## What works

Open a new Pascal file.

Declare instance of some known class from used unit, e.g. TList.

Type `MyInstance.` and then M-x company-complete.
This should be intelligent completion, listing TList properties/methods now.

* Completion aware of methods/properties in each namespace.

* Click on identifier jumps to declaration (in VS Code; TODO: how to get it in Emacs).

* When you start (, you see parameters of method/routine.

    TODO: how to show them all in Emacs?

TODO:

- Isopod pasls is extremely fragile when unit on uses clause not found,
  and its poor in finding such units.
  Needs
  - config to read units in Lazarus automatically?
  - read units in current project automatically.

- Explore how to configure it best from Emacs.
  For now I just bound "Tab" to company-capf.

  Any more functionality from company autocompletion?
    read https://company-mode.github.io/
  Any more functionality from LSP?

- Anything like "code complete" (Ctrl Shift C in Lazarus?)

- Anything like "just to interface" / "jump to implementation" from Lazarus

- See previous TODO: how to make pasls aware of CGE units

- what key shortcuts to show other parameters

- company-mode in Emacs can show docs in F1.
  How to configure it to show docs of CGE routine?
  It is useful from VS Code too?

- TODO: how to use this:

  C-w Â¶
  Display a buffer with the definition of the selected candidate (company-show-location).

- In Emacs: make completion not case sensitive, e.g. Event.is should complete IsKey.
