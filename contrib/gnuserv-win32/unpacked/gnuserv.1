.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
\fIgnuclient\fP allows the user to request a running GNU Emacs process to edit
the named files or directories.
.PP
\fIgnudoit\fP allows the user to request a running GNU Emacs process to
evaluate the given arguments inside a progn LISP form.
.PP
\fIgnuserv\fP is the server program that is set running by GNU Emacs to handle
all incoming and outgoing requests. It is not usually invoked directly, but is
started from GNU Emacs by loading the \fIgnuserv\fP package and evaluating 
the LISP form (gnuserv-start). 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.BI \-q
This option informs both \fIgnuclient\fP and \fIgnudoit\fP to exit once
connection has been made with the GNU Emacs process. Normally \fIgnuclient\fP
waits until all of the files on the command line have been finished with
(their buffers killed) by the GNU Emacs process, and \fIgnudoit\fP normally
waits around for evaluation of its arguments by the GNU Emacs process, and
prints the results or error conditions.
.TP 8
.BI \-h " hostname"
Used only with Internet-domain sockets, this option specifies the host
machine which should be running \fIgnuserv\fP.  If this option is not
specified then the value of the environment variable GNU_HOST is used
if set.  If no hostname is specified, and the GNU_HOST variable is not
set, an internet connection will not be attempted. N\.B.- \fIgnuserv\fP
does NOT allow internet connections unless the GNU_SECURE variable has
been specified and points at a file listing all trusted hosts. (See
SECURITY below.)

.br
Note that an internet address may be specified instead of a hostname which can
speed up connections to the server by quite a bit, especially if the client
machine is running YP.

.br
Note also that a hostname of \fBunix\fP can be used to specify that
the connection to the server should use a Unix-domain socket (if
supported) rather than an Internet-domain socket.
.TP 8
.BI \-p " port"
Used only with Internet-domain sockets, this option specifies the service port
used to communicate between server and clients. If this option is not
specified, then the value of the environment variable GNU_PORT is used, if
set, otherwise a service called ``gnuserv'' is looked up
in the services database. Finally, if no other value can be found for the
port, then a default port is used which is usually 21490 + uid.
.br
Note that since \fIgnuserv\fP doesn't allow command-line options, the port for
it will have to be specified via one of the alternative methods.
.TP 8
.BI \-r " pathname"
Used only with Internet-domain sockets, the pathname argument may be needed to
inform GNU Emacs how to reach the root directory of a remote machine.
\fIgnuclient\fP prepends this string to each path argument given. For example,
if you were trying to edit a file on a client machine called otter, whose root
directory was accessible from the server machine via the path /net/otter, then
this argument should be set to '/net/otter'. If this option is omitted, then
the value is taken from the environment variable GNU_NODE, if set, or the
empty string otherwise.
.TP 8
.BI "path"
This is the path of the file to be edited. If the file is a directory, then
the directory browsers dired or monkey are usually invoked instead.
.TP 8
.BI "sexpr"
This is part of a GNU Emacs LISP expression to evaluate. All the sexprs are
concatenated together and wrapped in a progn form before sending to
GNU Emacs. If no sexpr is supplied on the  \fIgnudoit\fP commandline,
\fIgnudoit\fP will read the sexpr to be evaluated from standard input.

.PP
.SH SETUP
If gnuserv was packaged along with your emacs distribution, you should
be able to start the server simply by evaluating the GNU Emacs lisp
form (gnuserv-start).  If that doesn't work, or if you obtained
gnuserv separately from your emacs distribution, copy the file
gnuserv.el into a directory on your GNU Emacs load-path. Load it into
GNU Emacs by evaluating the GNU Emacs lisp form (load "gnuserv"). You
should now be able to start the server by evaluating the lisp form
(gnuserv-start). 
.SH EXAMPLE
.RS 4
gnudoit -q '(mh-smail)'

gnuclient -h cuckoo -r /ange@otter: /tmp/*

.SH SYSV IPC 
SysV IPC is used to communicate between \fIgnuclient\fP, \fIgnudoit\fP and
\fIgnuserv\fP if the symbol SYSV_IPC is defined at the top of gnuserv.h. This
is incompatible with both Unix-domain and Internet-domain socket communication
as described below. A file called /tmp/gsrv??? is created as a key for the
message queue, and if removed will cause the communication between server and
client to fail until the server is restarted.
.SH UNIX-DOMAIN SOCKETS
A Unix-domain socket is used to communicate between \fIgnuclient\fP,
\fIgnudoit\fP and \fIgnuserv\fP if the symbol UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKETS is defined
at the top of gnuserv.h.  A file called /tmp/gsrvdir????/gsrv is created for
communication and if deleted will cause communication between server and
client to fail.  Only the user running gnuserv will be able to connect to
the socket.
.SH INTERNET-DOMAIN SOCKETS
Internet-domain sockets are used to communicate between \fIgnuclient\fP,
\fIgnudoit\fP and \fIgnuserv\fP if the symbol INTERNET_DOMAIN_SOCKETS is
defined at the top of gnuserv.h. Both Internet-domain and Unix-domain sockets
can be used at the same time. If a hostname is specified via -h or via
the GNU_HOST environment variable, \fIgnudoit\fP and \fIgnuclient\fP
establish connections using an internet domain socket. If not,
a local connection is attempted via either a unix-domain
socket or SYSV IPC."
.SH SECURITY
Using Internet-domain sockets, a more robust form of security is needed that
wasn't necessary with either Unix-domain sockets or SysV IPC.
.PP
\fIgnuserv\fP performs a limited form of security at the machine
level. By default no internet-domain socket is opened.  If the
variable GNU_SECURE can be found in \fIgnuserv\fP's environment, and
it names a readable filename, then this file is opened and assumed to
be a list of hosts, one per line, from which the server will allow
requests. Connections from any other host will be rejected. Even the
machine on which \fIgnuserv\fP is running is not permitted to make
connections unless its hostname is explicitly specified in this file.
Note that a host may be either a internet address or a hostname, and
that
.I any
user on an approved host may connect to your gnuserv and execute arbitrary
elisp (e.g., delete all your files).
If this file contains a lot of
hostnames then the server may take quite a time to start up.

.SH BUGS
.PP 
Ctrl-D's occurring in gnudoit input strings won't be handled correctly.
.PP 
NULs occurring in result strings don't get passed back to gnudoit properly.

.PP 
When using SYSV IPC, the maximum allowable sizes of a gnudoit request
and response are governed by the size of the message buffer (defined
at compile time). Responses that exceed the maximum allowed size are
truncated.

.PP
Long response strings that result from a gnudoit invocation may
sometimes cause the \fIgnuserv\fP process to exit if used with a
gnu-emacs version 19 release that predates release 23. This is due to
a bug in gnu-emacs, so an upgrade to a more recent version will cure
the problem. A similar problem may also occur in lucid emacs 19.9, but
should not in later versions.
