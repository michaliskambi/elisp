This is the Emacs configuration of Michalis Kamburelis
( http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/~michalis/ ).
I use this repo to synchronize my Emacs configuration between many systems.

Some of it is old, some of it is new.
Some of it is more generally-useful, some of it is very specific
to my personal needs and preferences.

Reuse as you like:)
