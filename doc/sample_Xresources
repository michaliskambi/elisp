! emacs ------------------------------------------------------------

! Font for Emacs. Although this can be set by elisp (see
! set-default-font function), it''s better to set 1st font by Xresources.
! Reason: this way Emacs initializes frame with this font,
! which means it will honour Emacs.geometry with this font.
! Otherwise, initial frame could be created with larger font,
! making Emacs.geometry clamped to something smaller.
! Emacs.font: -misc-fixed-medium-*-normal-*-15-*-*-*-c-*-iso8859-2
Emacs.font: DejaVu Sans Mono-15

! Window size
Emacs.geometry: 83x32+0+0

! Hide toolbar
Emacs.toolBar: 0

! use Emacs icon with window managers (otherwise Emacs gets standard
! window manager icon).
! Later: does not seem useful anymore, modern Emacs does this by default.
! Emacs.bitmapIcon: on
